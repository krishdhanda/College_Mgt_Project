# College_Mgt_Project
This is my College_Mgt_System Project which is useful for administrative, and user (both faculties and students) perspective.

## Step 1) Open login.py file to login.
-> Username : admin@mail.com
-> Password : 55555

## Step 2) : After login you can see the Admin Dashboard and at top left corner there are different menu options like home, Students, Fees etc through which you can navigate for multiple perpouses.

NOTE:- And after your work is done you can easily logout through that.

This interface is only for students and it also provides multiple menu options like Subjects, View marks, give faculty feedback etc.
